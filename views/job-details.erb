      <h1>About Able:</h1>
      <p>
        Able builds technology products in a portfolio model. We believe that people, teams, and processes are more important than the ideas themselves, so we’ve focused on bringing great people together, and investing in their growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        We’ve built products in a variety of industries. Everything from media to finance to toys to healthcare. Sometimes we work with management teams to help their businesses grow faster or unlock value using technology. Other times we start or buy businesses outright. Each time, we look for opportunities to leverage technology built at the portfolio-level to drive value faster.

        <br>
        We believe that a diverse team brings extraordinary success and we have created a work environment geared towards work/life balance and happiness.
